Post-Comp Software Notes:

jelly.launch currently works and stabilizes in Gazebo.
jelly_start_stab.launch and custom_ ... _stab.py files are the most recent files.

I want to sort through all scripts into just a few that stabilize, allocate, and a main function.

scripts/stabilization_hardware was preparation code for uploading to Jelly.

custom_controller.py Is the most recent simulation controller.

custom_thrust_allocator.py is the most recent simulation controller.

Every time I create a new script/script copy I should create a note detailing what the point is...

custom_trajectory_planner.py is used for trajectory testing in simulation

the trajectory folder inside scripts was used for setting up trajectory plotting/following on hardware. The plan was to upload that code to jelly for gate detection/following.

Build off of stab_main_stab.py
